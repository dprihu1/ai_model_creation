# RapidAI

**RapidAI** is a modular framework designed to accelerate the development of AI models. It enables developers and researchers to rapidly prototype, configure, and deploy machine learning and deep learning projects with minimal setup.

This toolkit provides a balance between flexibility and simplicity, offering both high-level scaffolding tools and low-level customization options.

---

## Key Features

- **Rapid Prototyping**: Quickly scaffold projects and experiment with new ideas.
- **Modular Design**: Reusable components for data loading, modeling, training, and evaluation.
- **Framework Compatibility**: Supports PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Hugging Face Transformers.
- **Project Generation**: Create directory structures from simple text-tree definitions.
- **CLI and Python API**: Use from the command line or integrate into existing Python workflows.
- **Template Library**: Built-in templates for common tasks such as image classification, text classification, and more.

---

## Use Cases

- Streamlining research workflows
- Building consistent AI/ML pipelines
- Automating repetitive training tasks
- Educating and onboarding new ML developers

---

## Installation

Install via PyPI:

```bash
pip install rapidai
````

Or install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rapidai.git
cd rapidai
pip install -e .
```

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Scaffold a new project from a text-based tree file:

```bash
rapidai scaffold my_project --from tree.txt
```

### 2. Initialize a project from a built-in template:

```bash
rapidai init image-classifier
```

### 3. Train a model:

```bash
rapidai train --config config.yaml
```

---

## Example Tree Input

```
my_project/
├── data/
│   ├── train.csv
│   └── test.csv
├── models/
│   └── model.py
├── config.yaml
└── train.py
```

RapidAI can parse this structure and generate the corresponding files and directories automatically.
